When trying to connect to MySQL, I get "access denied 
(java.lang.RuntimePermission modifyThreadGroup)" as an 
accesscontrolexception. I tried to find Jetty's policy file, but with 
no success. 



I had this problem. If tyour in eclipse try turning off Google App 
engine. Go to "Project->Properties->Google->App Engine" and uncheck 
the "Use Google App Engine" box.
